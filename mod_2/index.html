    <!--Dynamic Programming-->
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 inner"><p name="dp" class="content"><label for="dp" class="title first">Dynammic Programming</label><br>Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and 
        a computer programming method. The method was developed by Richard 
        Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, 
        from aerospace engineering to economics.In both contexts it refers to 
        simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler 
        sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems 
        cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points 
        in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer 
        science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into 
        sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the 
        sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.</p></div>
    <!--Back Tracking-->
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 inner"><p name="back" class="content"><label for="back" class="title second">Back Tracking</label><br>Backtracking is a class of algorithms for finding solutions to some 
        computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, 
        that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a 
        candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate 
        cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.[1]The classic textbook
         example of the use of backtracking is the eight queens puzzle, that 
         asks for all arrangements of eight chess queens on a standard 
         chessboard so that no queen attacks any other. In the common 
         backtracking approach, the partial candidates are arrangements of 
         k queens in the first k rows of the board, all in different rows and 
         columns. Any partial solution that contains two mutually attacking 
         queens can be abandoned.</p></div>
        <!--Divide and Conquer-->
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12 inner  last"> <p name="dnc" class="content lastbox"><label for="dnc" class="title third">Divide and Conquer</label><br> divide-and-conquer paradigm is often used to find an optimal 
            solution of a problem. Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem 
            into two or more similar, but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in 
            turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem. 
            Problems of sufficient simplicity are solved directly. For example, 
            to sort a given list of n natural numbers, split it into two lists of 
            about n/2 numbers each, sort each of them in turn, and interleave both 
            results appropriately to obtain the sorted version of the given list 
            (see the picture). This approach is known as the merge sort algorithm.</p></div>
